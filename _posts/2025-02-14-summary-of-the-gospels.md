## Motivation
I fell in love with the Bible when I gave my heart to Jesus Christ in 2023. This love has grown all the more to the extent that I've read the wonderful Word of God multiple times and studying deeper into it every day! Down below is a summary of each chapter of each of the Gospels. I want to use it as a reference to know about Jesus.

## Structure and setup
The graph was created with [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/). It is insanely powerful and comes with a lovely [repl](https://markmap.js.org/repl) to visualize from the start! It also has an amazing _Download as interactive HTML_ feature which is what I use to generate the graph you see below.
