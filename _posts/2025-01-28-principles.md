## What is it?
A principle is a truth, a fundamental way of life. One can think of a principle as the implementation of "because I said so". Google neatly adds to the definition by stating that it's the truth used as a foundation for a behavior or reason.

Many of us have principles we are vastly unaware of, but I want to share some of my own insights in some coding principles. I only recently (yesterday as of writing) discovered that I am extremely biased into a very specific principle.

## Different Principles
We will focus specifically on:
- LoB: Locality of Behavior
- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
- SoC: Separation of Concerns

### 1. Locality of Behavior
Our first principle states that a unit of code must be obvious from only looking at this unit of code. The "formal" definition, although vague, is just that. It is the principle that what I'm working on should be right here. To expand or perhaps start our understanding of this let's look at an example:

```groovy
// File: People.groovy

String SQL = "SELECT id, name, surname FROM people WHERE people.name = 'Liam';"

NativeQuery q = session.createNativeQuery(SQL)
q.executeUpdate()
```

From this the principle isn't immediately obvious, but allow me to show another example which **does not** satisfy the principle:

```sql
-- File: PeopleQuery.sql

SELECT id, name, surname FROM people WHERE people.name = 'Liam';
```

```groovy
// File: People.groovy

String sql = new File('/path/to/PeopleQuery.sql').text

NativeQuery q = session.createNativeQuery(sql)
q.executeUpdate()
```

Can you see the difference? If not, do not fear, I shall explain. The first utilizes the fact that the SQL statement is written right then and there. There is no other location for the SQL although it might change. The second separates the two into different files. They are coupled through code.

### 2. Don't Repeat Yourself
"Staying DRY" sadly doesn't mean avoiding the deep seas, but rather that you should avoid redundancy. The wheel is already invented, the developer must simply change its size, the rim, the shape, the use-case, the color, the threading, the material, the spikes, and a few other override-able properties! I'm just kidding, there is truly no need to re-invent everything. A developer must strive to always remove redundancy as often as machinely possible! Below a wet and dry example:

```go

slice := [1,2,3,4,5]
shuffledSlice := slice.copy()

r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))
r.Shuffle(len(shuffledSlice), func(i, j int) {
    shuffledSlice[i], shuffledSlice[j] = shuffledSlice[j], shuffledSlice[i]
})

var shuffledTwiceSlice := shuffledSlice.copy()
r.Shuffle(len(shuffledSlice), func(i, j int) {
    shuffledSlice[i], shuffledSlice[j] = shuffledSlice[j], shuffledSlice[i]
})
```

```go

func ShuffleSlice(a []int) []int {
    r := rand.New(rand.NewSource(time.Now().UnixNano()))
    r.Shuffle(len(a), func(i, j int) {
        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
    })

    return a
}

slice := [1,2,3,4,5]
shuffledSlice := ShuffleSlice(slice)
shuffledTwiceSlice := ShuffleSlice(shuffledSlice)
```

A clear difference between the two! Both will achieve the same, however the second is much more clear and the `shuffleSlice` function can be used anywhere else it will be required.

### 3. Separation of Concerns
Our last known principle is once more quite basic in understanding. One must simply separate concerns. Each section must address an individual concern which can be thought of as a small detail or part of the program. The easiest way to show this wonderful and almost perfect design principle is to take a look at some good ol' frontend code! Look at the difference between the following snippets:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Inline Example</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
        }
        .btn {
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px;
            border: none;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Inline CSS and JS</h1>
    <button class="btn" onclick="changeText()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="text">Hello, World!</p>
    
    <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById("text").innerText = "You clicked the button!";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Versus: 

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Separated Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Separated CSS and JS</h1>
    <button class="btn" onclick="changeText()">Click Me</button>
    <p id="text">Hello, World!</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
```css
/* styles.css */

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    text-align: center;
}
.btn {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

```js
// script.js

function changeText() {
    document.getElementById("text").innerText = "You clicked the button!";
}
```
This principle is clean, elegant and simple. However, the negative is that a change made to any file might have a consequence somewhere within your project. For example changing the style of an element in `styles.css` might cause multiple pages to look differently as the element is used throughout.

## Liam's favorite!
It should be quite obvious from the wording above, but let me explain by poem.

> To say this, to think that  
My mind, always busy with wonder  
Easily forgotten, a blunder  
The information growing fat  

> A struggle to keep track  
But there is a solution  
A path to clear resolution  
Separated, strong, a wolf-pack  

> The design almost perfect, but a dimple  
It is clean, elegant and simple  
Moving away form the law of diminishing returns  
I have separated my concerns  

I prefer the separation of concerns design principle although sometimes difficult to find out the immediate context. However, the elegance sells it to me. To view a code change on `styles.css` gives me a clear indication of what I expect.
