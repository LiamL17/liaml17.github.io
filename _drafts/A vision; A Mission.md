## Starting something new
It has occurred to me that I often start without the correct processes in place. 

## The Vision
Sadly not the fascinating and neglected character from the Avengers, but rather what you envision the outcome to look like. I am ashamed to admit that I've only recently realized this. A vision is _how it looks in your head once it's finished_. Many books, articles and experts will wholeheartedly disagree with my simplified definition, and I would advise you to listen to their tenure-backed definition every day of the week! However, having done much research into new projects, where to start, how to start and simply failing time and time again, I realized that I overcomplicated much of my vision. A vision should be simple and summarized within a single breath. I don't think a word limit or sentence limit would suffice, but rather the concept or idea.

The vision should also be ambitious and bold! It can be as large as reaching a billion people or even interplanetary travel as with Elon's dreams. It is the bold visions of the past that allows us to dream into the future.

An example vision for a company selling toy cars would be.
> Seeing fathers collecting cars with their sons.

This is quite vague, but it's a clear picture. I envision a collection where a dad is showing off to his friends all the cars he has that his son has collected. A competition between dads of how their sons are collecting the cars!

Now the question arises, how do we reach this ambitious vision?

## The Mission
**How do we achieve the vision**. This is the summary of the mission. It is a summarized overview of what needs to happen. Where the vision is the picture, the mission is the plan. It is the verb(s) that requires execution to reach the ambitious goals set. The mission must be specific, simple and formal. By formal I don't mean in writing style, but rather not something that is able to change almost ever. 

Taking our example from above how can we achieve this? What can we focus on daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, forever to reach our vision?
