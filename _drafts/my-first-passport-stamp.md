title: My first passport stamp

## The unexpected
I am fortunate that part of my onboarding at [Unifi](https://unifi.credit/za/) requires me to get some branch experience. This involves flying to a country where we have branches and sitting behind a desk serving customers. This is absolutely amazing and I aspire to have goals like these in my own company one day. Given this task, I had to fetch my passport and after almost 4 years I finally overcame that great feat!

As I was staring at my desert blank passport I envisioned it full of stamps from all over the world. The likes of USA, Ireland, UAE, Japan, heck even [Sealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand) if at all possible! However, I never envisioned African countries. I have never known or been fascinated by any African tradition. One could blame my upbringing, but I don't hold it to my parents.

Fast forward a few days and here I am on a tiny plane with 4 colleagues on our way to Lusaka, Zambia! A two hour flight takes us to Livingstone airport for a sip of fuel for the plane and another two hours to arrive at Lusaka. Already in the flight I started observing what the differences would be between my home country, being South Africa of course, and the beautiful third-world Zambia. Below a list of wonderful differences between South Africa and Zambia! Some of these might be insensitive as the first world cannot comprehend that we might think in such a manner, but all of the writing is for pure enjoyment and to reflect on what I learned in this central African country.
