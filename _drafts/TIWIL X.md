# Ten ten ten
We have reached a great milestone for learning! It might have taken just over 2 years and a week, but here we are. The tenth edition of **_This Is What I Learned_** features a fun collection of my past few weeks. Typically I want some theme, but this time randomness is key. I hope something is relatable, but more-so that you learn a thing or two.

## Copilot
I have started using Github Copilot since it offers a free 30 day trial. Another developer at my work uses it and it seemed quite decent. 
My experience so far has been amazing! We have a [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) codebase and Copilot works perfectly! I haven't used advanced features such as agents or reasoning (if it got it), but it is easily worth the $10 per month already.

## Epiphany
I thought of this beautiful word and recalled that it meant a large or sudden revelation / understanding of something. However, when I googled the word I found an even more beautiful definition. Google states the [definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=epiphany&oq=&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggBEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg5MgYIARBFGDsyDQgCEC4Y1AIYsQMYgAQyCggDEAAYsQMYgAQyCggEEAAYsQMYgAQyCggFEAAYsQMYgAQyCggGEAAYsQMYgAQyCggHEAAYsQMYgAQyBwgIEAAYjwIyBwgJEAAYjwLSAQgxNjIxajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as

Oh how lovely! This word has such a deeper meaning to what I believed it to be.

## Obsidian features
I have been using Obsidian for over a year now and I am still deeply in love! It it's awesome in every aspect and I am not even using 50% of the features... I recently discovered themes. Since then I have changed the color of _everything_. The more customized the workspace, the better! I have also started diving into some neat plugins. Such as this post being committed to git through Obsidian! Also, [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)! Obsidian has built-in Vim support. This gets me one step closer to a Vim-filled world.

## Preparation is key; Safety is key
I have cell groups on Wednesday where I have to prepare a topic for the group to discuss. This includes a few verses and a slideshow with announcements. The evening also includes a worship aspect where we dim all lights and sing our hearts out with the lyrics on the screen for all to see. This week I learned the importance of preparation and safety... I left the office at 17h05 with a laptop fully charged. I arrived at the location with my battery on 77% and a '1h 7min remaining' message on my battery. This made the whole evening a struggle and reminded me how important it is to prepare for all scenarios! Moreso, I picked up my charger and decided it won't be needed. I opted for the _dangerous_ route and as we all expect, got bitten! It is crucial to prepare and be safe.[^1]

[^1]: Don't get me wrong, danger is good too. However, most times the safe route would be of more benefit that the dangerous.
